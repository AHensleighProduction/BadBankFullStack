# First Bank West - Full Stack

This project contains a full stack banking app. Users can create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, and view all data in a dedicated section. Additionally, a login page has been added with a new capability for an "admin" section, serving as the new home for the "all data" page.

## Roadmap for Improvements
